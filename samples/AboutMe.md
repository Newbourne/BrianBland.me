### Who am I?

A husband, a father, a son, and a software developer in the Cincinnati area.

### Studies

Currently in the process of abandoning NodeJS and actively pursuing Google go.
I'm professionally grinding the Microsoft .NET stack. I am seeking to do more
lower level development and jump into hardware. I'm through working solely in
the virtual world.

### Mission

I have several research projects that I want to start. My goal is to utilize
 this platform to discuss and share my progress and "attempt" to educate 
others on my knowledge gained. Everything I do will be available on my GitHub.com
