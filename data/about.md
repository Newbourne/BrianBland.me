Over the years, Mr. Bland has worked with many different technologies. It all started when he graduated in 2005 and needed to pick a technology stack to jump start his career. Having been familiar with Microsoft Visual Studio and using C++, he figured it was a no-brainer to go down the .NET route.

## Status: Underling

### Contractor? What?
Right out the gate Mr. Bland was fortunate to grab a six month contract position working for Breeders' Cup Limited. A very small outfit in Lexington, KY. He was to be the sole ASP.NET VB/C# Developer working under the VP of Technology. Mr. Bland quickly discovered his distaste for Visual Basic, but fell in love with C#. What a beautiful language. After completing his assignment of maintaining existing .NET applications and building a brand new Silverlight betting application he wanted to stick with Silverlight and C# moving forward. Never forget, R.I.P Silverlight.

### Propane and propane accessories
Mr. Bland landed a position in Florence, KY for a top (#3) propane company in the nation, Heritage Propane. He was to be a Software Analyst working on the companies flagship ASP.NET C# + Silverlight application. Technology aside, professionally, this was the greatest position Mr. Bland could imagine. Constantly, being teased as the young underling. Mr. Bland worked with extraordinary professionals. The company had great discipline. From the Director down, everyone understood the Software Process and followed it firmly. Mr. Bland worked on the flagship application for a year. Heritage Propane, was then purchased by AmeriGas. The leading propane company in the nation. His flagship application was shelved and never heard of again. Never forget, R.I.P Fuelscape. 

Mr. Bland continued working for AmeriGas building a few ASP.NET/MVC applications. Silverlight was all but abandoned. AmeriGas would soon sever their Florence office and place Mr. Bland back on the streets.

## Status: Senior-ish

### The Dream
After leaving AmeriGas, Mr. Bland went searching. He desired a smaller company where he could have a bigger impact in the development and software process methodology. He discovered, Combined Public Communication, a communications company in Cold Spring, KY. Unique, is the best way to describe CPC. It is a company that previously used multiple consultant companies to build their applications and now wanted to do it in house. Mr. Bland was to be the first "Senior" developer the company hired.

CPC has many legacy applications: .NET, ASP.NET, Python and PHP. They wanted to move towards more open source and cheaper technologies. It was at this point Mr. Bland started his developmental walkabout. He started playing with different languages and frameworks: Ruby on Rails, Python (w/ Flask) and eventually settled on Node. He started following Eran Hammer and digging into Node's open source community. 

It may have been the switch from strongly typed C#, to weakly typed JavaScript, or the transition from Visual Studio IDE to WebStorm, then to Sublime and the command-line. It may have been the appealing asynchronous nature of Node and the thrill of developing at the bleeding edge. Honestly, he couldn't tell you. Mr. Bland selected Node and dove in deep. He started building all of CPC's new applications with Node. He always used Hapi to drive his JSON API back-end and experimented with different front-end technologies like Angular and React. It was a dream to explore so many different frameworks and use them in production.

### Displacement
After an extended period working with Node to diligently build quality software. There was something missing. He noticed CPC didn't share his enthusiam for software and the discipline required to build maitainable solutions. Mr. Bland would occassionally play the role of Project Manager, organizing sprints and planning release dates to have it all unfold. It appeared as though CPC was satisfied with how they had built and managed applications in the past.

## Current Status: Professional Student
Now Mr. Bland considers himself more of a student. He recently discovered some of the limitations of JavaScript and how one tool will NOT satisfy all needs. Lately, he has been studying Google Go and universal JavaScript applications using React/Redux.
